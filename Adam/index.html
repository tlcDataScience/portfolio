intro: >
  My name is [student_nickname], and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 2, and I enjoy designing robots to automate daily tasks.
  Robotics sparked my interest in Python, where I began writing code to solve math problems and explore text-based programming. I also learned Pygame and created fun, educational games for my friends to play and challenge each other.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.
robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Touch activated Ferris Wheel"
    heading: Touch activated Ferris Wheel
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. 
      Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. 
      Among many other projects, I created a ferris wheel that spins only if the touch sensor is activated

  - title: "Project 2: Rack and Pinion cuckoo clock"
    heading: Rack and Pinion cuckoo clock
    description: >
      Using an ultrasonic sensor, I created a rack and pinion cuckoo clock that moves if it detects someone in front of it. 
      I determined the threshold value that corresponds to detecting a person.

  - title: "Project 3: Touch Activated Gripper"
    heading: Touch Activated Gripper
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to use the concepts and design skills to create a gripper that is activated to open and close only when touch sensor is activated. 
      I could then recreate the arcade game of picking up and releasing anything at home

  - title: "Project 4: Touch activated globe on turret"
    heading: Touch activated globe on turret
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved spinning our world globe. They had to spin and stop them manually. 
      I decided to create an automated pinwheel that starts moving when the program starts. 
      It will stop when the touch sensor detects my hand and return to the original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Touch and ultrasonic activated Lazy Susan "
    heading: Touch and ultrasonic activated Lazy Susan
    description: >
      My family and I love hosting dinners with our extended family, 
      and I decided to recreate an automated lazy susan used at our dining table with the LEGO technic parts. 
      In my project, using the concept of nested if else, the lazy susan starts and moves in one direction when a button is activated. 
      It will switch directions if the ultrasonic sensor detects the personâ€™s hand.

  - title: "Project 6: Touch speed activated treadmill "
    heading: Touch speed activated treadmill
    description: >
      I love to exercise on a treadmill. 
      I decided to do a re-create an automated one whose speed could be controlled using the touch sensor. 
      Using the Lego technic parts, I created a treadmill. With the coding concepts of variables and if else, 
      the treadmill increases speed each time the touch sensor is activated, just like a treadmill in real life.
