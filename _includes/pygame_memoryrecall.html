        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>Good morning, everyone and today I'm excited to present my amazing project I've developed using Pygame. The motivation behind this project was to create an interactive and educational game that allows children to practice memorizing digits in a fun and engaging way.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>My problem statement is to design a game that encourages children to practice memorizing digits before answering, with the aim of fostering an enjoyable learning experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>To address this challenge, I ideated a concept where images containing new digits would spawn randomly on the screen. Users, particularly children, would be able to interact with the game by answering questions, implementing a scoring system to track their progress. The goal was to ensure a child-friendly and engaging gameplay experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Leveraging the Pygame library, I implemented the solution, which consists of a main game loop featuring random images of digits, a scoring mechanism, and a defined game-over condition. The result is a functional and visually appealing game that aligns with the initial goal of providing an enjoyable learning experience for children.</p>
