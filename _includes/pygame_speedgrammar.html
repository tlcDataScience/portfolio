    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      In this exciting project, I created a game called SpeedGrammar using Pygame. In SpeedGrammar, players race against the clock to decide if sentences are grammatically correct. I built the game with different screens and animations, and it taught me so much about <strong>object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong>. I organized my code by creating separate classes for the game screen, the scoreboard, the instructions, and even the countdown timer. It was like building a cool machine where every part worked perfectly together!
      <br><br>
      Designing the user interface was one of the best partsâ€”placing text, images, and handling key presses made the game interactive and fun. I learned how to use loops to keep the game running until the right answer was given or time ran out, and I used <strong>if statements</strong> to check whether a sentence was correct. This process taught me how decisions in code work just like choices in a real puzzle.
      <br><br>
      SpeedGrammar also challenged me to think quickly and work with time. The game speeds up as you progress, so you must pay attention to every word and punctuation mark, just like a true grammar detective! I even added different levels where the difficulty increases, and every correct answer makes the game a bit faster. This project not only improved my coding skills but also made me appreciate the importance of grammar and clear communication.
      <br><br>
      Overall, working on SpeedGrammar was an awesome adventure that combined logic, creativity, and the thrill of a race against time. I felt like a real game developer, solving puzzles and building a game that helps people learn grammar in a fun and interactive way!
