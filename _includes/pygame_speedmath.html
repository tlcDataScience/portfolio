    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      In this exciting project called <strong>"SpeedMath"</strong>, I used Pygame to create a fast-paced math quiz game. The game shows a math equation on the screen and challenges you to decide whether the equation is True or False before time runs out. I designed the game using object-oriented programming (OOP), which means I organized the code into classes for the game screen, the scoreboard, and even the instructions—just like putting together a cool LEGO set!
      <br><br>
      The best part is that the game tests your quick math skills. For example, an equation like "3 + 5 = 8" will appear, and you have to press Y if you think it’s correct or N if you believe it’s wrong. I used loops and if-else statements to make sure the game runs smoothly and to update the score automatically.
      <br><br>
      I also added a timer so that every second counts—this makes the game both challenging and fun. Creating SpeedMath taught me not only how to code but also how to think fast and solve problems under pressure. It was a fantastic way to mix creativity with logic, and I felt like a real game developer when I saw my ideas come to life on the screen!

      As a young Singaporean, I love learning new things and exploring how technology works. SpeedMath is my way of making math exciting and showing that even hard subjects can be turned into fun games.
