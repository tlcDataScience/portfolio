    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, I created a game called <strong>"WhatAnimal?"</strong> using Pygame. I love animals, so I wanted to design a game where each turn shows a picture of a different animal for you to guess! I used my passion for animals and my curiosity about coding to make this fun challenge.
      <br><br>
      To build this game, I used <strong>object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong> to organize my code into clear, manageable parts. I made separate classes for the game screen, for drawing the animal images, and for keeping track of scores and instructions. It was like building with LEGO blocks – each piece worked on its own, but together they formed an awesome game.
      <br><br>
      In "WhatAnimal?", each round shows a different animal, like a cat, dog, elephant, or even a zebra! You get to choose the right animal from four options, and there’s a timer to add a bit of excitement. This made the game fun and fast-paced, and it helped me learn how to handle key presses and events to make the game interactive.
      <br><br>
      Overall, "WhatAnimal?" is not just a guessing game – it’s a playful adventure that shows how coding can be creative and exciting. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it!
