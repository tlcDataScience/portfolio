    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, I created a game called <strong>"WhatCountry?"</strong> using Pygame. The idea came from my curiosity about the flags of different countries and my love for learning about cultures as a young Singaporean. I wanted to make a game that challenges players to recognize which flag belongs to which country, while also teaching me more about coding and design!
      <br><br>
      To build this game, I used <strong>object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong> to organize my code into clear, manageable parts. I created separate classes for the game screen, the flag drawing functions, and even the scoreboard and instructions. It was like building a set of LEGOs—each small block worked on its own, but together they formed a complete and exciting game.
      <br><br>
      In "WhatCountry?", each turn displays a flag that I draw using simple, solid-color stripes. To make sure even white parts are visible, I outline each flag with a thin black line. I included at least seven different flags, such as those for France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, and Romania. The game then asks a question like, "Is this the flag of France?" If you think the flag is correct, you press Y; if not, you press N. There’s even a timer that adds a bit of excitement, making sure you answer quickly!
      <br><br>
      Along the way, I learned how to design user interfaces that display important information like scores, turn numbers, and timers. Handling key presses and events taught me how to make the game interactive and responsive. I enjoyed combining coding with creativity, and it was super fun to see my ideas come to life on the screen.
      <br><br>
      Overall, "WhatCountry?" is not just a quiz about flags—it’s an adventure that takes you around the world and shows you how programming can be both educational and entertaining. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
