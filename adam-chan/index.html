intro: >
  My name is [student_nickname], and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 2, and I enjoy designing robots to automate daily tasks.
  Robotics sparked my interest in Python, where I began writing code to solve math problems and explore text-based programming. 
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.
robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Touch activated Bumper Car"
    heading: Touch activated Bumper Car
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. 
      Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), 
      together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. 
      Among many other projects, 
      I created a bumper car that reverses if the touch sensor is activated when hitting the wall.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic activated sliding door"
    heading: Ultrasonic activated sliding door
    description: >
      Using an ultrasonic sensor, 
      I created a sliding door that opens and closes once it detects someone in front of it. 
      I determined the threshold value that corresponds to what I determine is too close or still far.

  - title: "Project 3: Touch activated gripper"
    heading: Touch Activated Gripper
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently,
      I decided to use the concepts and design skills to create a gripper that is activated to open and close only when touch sensor is activated. 
      I could then recreate the arcade game of picking up and releasing anything at home

  - title: "Project 4: Touch activated pinwheel"
    heading: Touch activated pinwheel
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved spinning the pinwheel. I decided to create an automated one that starts moving when the program starts. 
      It will stop when the touch sensor is activated and return to the original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Colour and ultrasonic sensor activated top"
    heading: Colour and ultrasonic sensor activated top
    description: >
      My friends and I love playing with tops. 
      I decided to recreate an automated spinning top. 
      I coded it to move when it is activated by a colour sensor. 
      I could control the direction it spins using an ultrasonic sensor. 
      Depending on the distance someone is from the top, it would spin clockwise or anti-clockwise.

  - title: "Project 6: Touch activated increasing power generator "
    heading: Touch activated increasing power generator
    description: >
      When I was on a holiday, 
      I saw a manually operated power generator where the operator had to manually spin the lever for the generator to increase speed. 
      I decided to recreate an automated one the LEGO technic parts. 
      In my project, using the concept of variables, the generator increases speed each time the touch sensor is activated.
