intro: >
  Hello, I am Aiden Leong! I enjoy building robots and using coding to solve real-world problems. Starting with block-based coding helped me understand how to control my robots and test new ideas. Learning robotics has strengthened my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, because I have to break big challenges into smaller steps and troubleshoot when things don’t work as expected. It has also taught me patience and creativity, since designing, building, and programming robots often requires multiple experiments and improvements. Through robotics, I’m learning how software and hardware work together, which helps me better understand technology and how it can be used to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient.

    heading: Catapult
    description: I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, I programmed my designs to perform specific actions based on real-time input. For example, I created a catapult  mechanism that swings to hit the target when the touch sensor is activated—demonstrating how sensor-triggered automation is used in real-world systems  that respond to user
