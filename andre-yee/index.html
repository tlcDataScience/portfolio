intro: >
  Hi, I'm [student_nickname]!
  I enjoy building robots and using coding to solve real-world problems.
  Starting with block-based coding helped me understand how to control my robots and test new ideas.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Touch Activated Bumper Car"
    heading: Touch Activated Bumper Car
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs.
      Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met.
      Among many other projects, I created a bumper car that reverses if the touch sensor is activated when hitting the wall.

  - title: "Project 2: Colour Activated Sushi Belt"
    heading: Colour Activated Sushi Belt
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one.
      Using the Lego Technic parts and a colour sensor, I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green.
      This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Touch Activated Gripper"
    heading: Touch Activated Gripper
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to use the concepts and design skills to create a gripper that is activated to open and close only when touch sensor is activated.
      I could then recreate the arcade game of picking up and releasing anything at home.

  - title: "Project 4: Spinning Rabbit Head"
    heading: Spinning Rabbit Head
    description: >
      I created a motorized, sensor-activated windmill designed to reduce the need for manual operation.
      It automatically activates when a person approaches to begin work.
      The windmill will only stop when two specific colors are detected by the color sensor, a task controlled by the person in charge.
      This ensures that no one can tamper with the system.
