  - title: "Project 1: Touch Activated Ping Pong Racket"
    heading: Touch Activated Ping Pong Racket
    description: I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. Among many other projects, I created a ping pong racket that hits the ball if the touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 2: Colour Activated Sushi Belt"
    heading: Colour Activated Sushi Belt
    description: I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. Using the lego technic parts and a colour sensor, I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Colour Activated Shooter"
    heading: Colour Activated Shooter
    description: Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to use the concepts of conditional statements, colour detection and output controls to create a secure and precise shooter that fires a shot when the colour sensor detects 2 specific colours in the coded order.

  - title: "Project 4: Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: Automated Rabbit Head
    description: My younger siblings loved playing with rabbits and spinning them around. I decided to create an automated rabbit head  that starts moving when the program starts. It will stop when the ultrasonic sensor detects someone near it and returns to the original position. This device will be able to run independently without the need for their manual control.

  - title: "Project 5: Colour and Ultrasonic Sensor Activated Top"
    heading: Colour and Ultrasonic Sensor Activated Top
    description: Playing the top is my childhood game and I decided to recreate a sensor-controlled spinning top using LEGO technic parts and coded it to move when it is activated by a colour sensor. The direction it moves is controlled by the reading of the ultrasonic sensor. It is designed to enhance user engagement and ensures consistent gameplay with minimal effort needed for monitoring or control.

  - title: "Project 6: Colour Activated Speed Increasing and Touch Activated Speed Decreasing Merry Go Round"
    heading: Colour Activated Speed Increasing and Touch Activated Speed Decreasing Merry Go Round
    description: I built a lego model of a merry go round that is fully automated to replicate how a real amusement ride would respond to inputs from sensors. The colour sensor is used to increase the rotation speed while the touch sensor slows it down to enhance user experience and safety.

  <p>
    Hi, I am {{ page.student_name }}, and I love exploring robotics and block‑based coding. I enjoy solving problems by building creative projects that mix hardware and code. My projects range from designing robots using LEGO Technic parts to programming sensors with block‑based code!
