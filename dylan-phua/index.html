intro: >
  Hi i am My name is [student_nickname], and I am 12 years old. I began learning robotics in Primary 3 with Lego Mindstorms and block-based coding, 
  which sparked my interest in designing robots to automate daily tasks. 
  This experience taught me to think logically and creatively to solve real-world problems.
  Wanting to go beyond block coding, I started learning Python, which allows me to solve math problems with code and think step by step. Later, 
  I explored Pygame to build educational games that make learning fun and competitive for my friends. This not only improved my programming skills but also showed me how technology can bring people together and support learning.

  - title: "Project 1: Touch Activated Bumper Car"
    heading: Touch Activated Bumper Car
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a collisionâ€”mimicking real-world applications of obstacle detection used 
      in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic activated Tractor"
    heading: Ultrasonic activated Tractor
    description: >
      I built a LEGO-based tractor model designed to simulate real-life functionality. 
      It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and automatically stop when objects are within a threshold distance that I configured. 
      This demonstrates the potential advantages of automation and smart technology in modern farming.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance sensor Coin dispenser"
    heading: Distance sensor Coin dispenser
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to use the concepts of conditional statements, 
      colour detection and output controls to create a secure and precise shooter that fires a shot when the colour sensor detects 2 specific colours in the coded order. 
      This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can be used to develop automated systems, 
      with potential applications in intelligent defense technologies.
