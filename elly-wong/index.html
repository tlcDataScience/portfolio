  - title: "Project 1: Touch Activated Flags on a Tower"
    heading: Touch Activated Flags on a Tower
    description: "I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to design and build mechanical structures. Integrating coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) to control behavior based on sensor input., I created interactive models that respond to real-world stimuli. Among many other projects, I created a tower with four flags that spins only if the touch sensor is activated, demonstrating how automation and conditional logic are used in real-world systems to enhance safety and efficiency."

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Door Mechanism"
    heading: Ultrasonic Activated Door Mechanism
    description: "I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and using an ultrasonic sensor, I built a rack-and-pinion door mechanism that automatically opens when it detects someone approaching. I set a threshold distance to reliably identify when a person is close enough to trigger the door. This project simulates real-world automatic door systems commonly found in malls, offices, and public transport, where proximity sensors ensure convenient and hands-free access while enhancing safety and energy efficiency."

  - title: "Project 3: Ultrasonic Activated Coin Dispenser"
    heading: Ultrasonic Activated Coin Dispenser
    description: "Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, similar to those used in vending machines."

  - title: "Project 4: Ultrasonic Activated Spinning Rabbit Head"
    heading: Ultrasonic Activated Spinning Rabbit Head
    description: "My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, I decided to create an automated version of the toy. In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position."

  - title: "Project 5: Color Sensor Activated Tea Cup Ride"
    heading: "Color Sensor Activated Tea Cup Ride"
    description: "As someone who enjoys visiting amusement parks—especially the tea cup ride, I recreated a classic amusement park teacup ride using LEGO Technic parts. It incorporates two color sensors to make decisions about when and how to spin, based on both the color detected and the amount of reflected light. This adds a layer of safety and control that reflects how real-world rides use environment-sensitive automation."

  - title: "Project 6: Touch Activated Increasing & Decreasing Treadmill"
    heading: "Touch Activated Increasing & Decreasing Treadmill"
    description: "As someone who enjoys exercising on a treadmill, I decided to recreate an automated treadmill using LEGO Technic parts. This miniature version functions similarly to a real treadmill—its speed is controlled by user input. With the use of a touch sensor, and coding concepts such as variables and if-else statements, the treadmill increases speed with each press—just like speed adjustments on a real gym machine."
