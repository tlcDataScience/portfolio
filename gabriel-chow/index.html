intro: >
  Hi, I'm [student_nickname]!
  I love building robots and coming up with creative ways to solve real-world problems. I started learning robotics in Primary 4 with Lego Mindstorms and block-based coding. That’s where I first learned how to control robots and test different ideas.
  After a while, I wanted to try something more advanced, so I started learning Python. Python helped me think step by step, write my own programs, and even solve tricky math problems without pen and paper.
  I also explored game development using Pygame, creating fun and educational games for my friends to play. Competing in these games makes learning feel like a fun challenge instead of just studying.
  Combining robotics and Python makes me excited because I can build projects that help people, make learning more enjoyable, and inspire others to be creative with technology. I hope you enjoy seeing what I’ve built!

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ping Pong Racket"
    heading: "Ping Pong Racket"
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. Among many other projects, I created a ping pong racket that hits the ball if the touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 2: Sushi Belt"
    heading: "Sushi Belt"
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. Using the LEGO technic parts and a colour sensor, I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    heading: "Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    description: >
      Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, similar to those used in vending machines.

  - title: "Project 4: Automated Rabbit Head Turret"
    heading: "Automated Rabbit Head Turret"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, I decided to create an automated version of the toy. In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Two Colour Sensors Controlled Tea Cup Ride"
    heading: "Two Colour Sensors Controlled Tea Cup Ride"
    description: >
      Playing the top is my childhood game and I decided to recreate a sensor-controlled spinning top using LEGO technic parts and coded it to move when it is activated by a colour sensor. The direction it moves is controlled by the reading of the ultrasonic sensor. It is designed to enhance user engagement and ensures consistent gameplay with minimal effort needed for monitoring or control.

  - title: "Project 6: Standard Robot to Follow the Line"
    heading: "Standard Robot to Follow the Line"
    description: >
      I built a LEGO model of two swings that are fully automated to replicate how a real amusement ride would respond to inputs from sensors. The colour sensor is used to decrease the rotation speed of swing 1 while the touch sensor increases the speed of swing 2. This enhances user experience and safety.
