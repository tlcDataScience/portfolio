intro: >
  My name is Gabriel Chow and I am 12 years old this year. I started learning robotics with the Lego Mindstorms together with block-based coding when I was in Primary 4. I enjoy working on different structures and robots, designing and building them to automate routine daily tasks in my life.
  Learning robotics helped me learn how to think logically and creatively to use technology to explore different ideas to solve real-world problems. I was eager to explore beyond block-based coding. This sparked my interest in learning Python, text-based coding. 
  With Python, I can tell the computer what to do by writing instructions, solving my math problem sums without the use of pen and paper. 
  Python can help me by making tricky problems easier to solve with code. It will also teach me how to think carefully and solve problems step by step, which is useful for all kinds of learning.
  Beyond honing my Python fundamentals, I wanted to create games that were beneficial to students. I learned how to use Pygame, which is a library that lets you build interactive games easily. Using Pygame, I made different games designed for my friends to play and challenge each other.
  These games allow my friends to compete against each other, making learning feel like a fun competition instead of a boring task. It’s exciting to see how coding can bring people together through play while also making studying more enjoyable. 
  This experience not only improved my programming skills but also taught me how to think creatively about using technology to help others learn.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ping Pong Racket"
    heading: "Ping Pong Racket"
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. Among many other projects, I created a ping pong racket that hits the ball if the touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 2: Sushi Belt"
    heading: "Sushi Belt"
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. Using the LEGO technic parts and a colour sensor, I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    heading: "Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    description: >
      Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, similar to those used in vending machines.

  - title: "Project 4: Automated Rabbit Head Turret"
    heading: "Automated Rabbit Head Turret"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, I decided to create an automated version of the toy. In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Two Colour Sensors Controlled Tea Cup Ride"
    heading: "Two Colour Sensors Controlled Tea Cup Ride"
    description: >
      Playing the top is my childhood game and I decided to recreate a sensor-controlled spinning top using LEGO technic parts and coded it to move when it is activated by a colour sensor. The direction it moves is controlled by the reading of the ultrasonic sensor. It is designed to enhance user engagement and ensures consistent gameplay with minimal effort needed for monitoring or control.

  - title: "Project 6: Standard Robot to Follow the Line"
    heading: "Standard Robot to Follow the Line"
    description: >
      I built a LEGO model of two swings that are fully automated to replicate how a real amusement ride would respond to inputs from sensors. The colour sensor is used to decrease the rotation speed of swing 1 while the touch sensor increases the speed of swing 2. This enhances user experience and safety.
