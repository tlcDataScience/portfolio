intro: >
  Hi, I'm Garett Lim!
  I enjoy building robots and using coding to solve real-world problems.
  Starting with block-based coding helped me understand how to control my robots and test new ideas.
  Later, I wanted to learn something more advanced, so I began using Python.
  Python showed me how to write my own programs and think in new ways.
  Combining robotics and Python makes me excited to create projects that can help others and make learning fun.
  I hope you enjoy seeing what I have built!

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ping Pong Racket"
    heading: Ping Pong Racket
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. 
      Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. 
      Among many other projects, I created a ping pong racket that hits the ball if the touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    heading: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor
    description: >
      I built a LEGO-based tractor model designed to simulate real-life functionality.
      It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and automatically stop when objects are within a threshold distance that I configured.
      This demonstrates the potential advantages of automation and smart technology in modern farming.

  - title: "Project 3: Color Activated Shooter"
    heading: Color Activated Shooter
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to use the concepts of conditional statements, colour detection and output controls to create a secure and precise shooter that fires a shot when the colour sensor detects 2 specific colours in the coded order. 
      This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can be used to develop automated systems, with potential applications in intelligent defense technologies.

  - title: "Project 4: Colour and Ultrasonic Automated Car"
    heading: Colour and Ultrasonic Automated Car
    description: >
      I decided to create an automated car using LEGO Technic parts that can return to its original parking position after detecting an obstacle.
      This project simulates the logic behind autonomous parking systems found in modern vehicles.
      Using the concept of nested while loops with variables, I programmed the car to activate and begin moving when the colour sensor detects a specific colour.
      While in motion, the car continuously checks for obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor.
      Once an obstacle is detected, the car automatically stops and reverses back to its starting pointâ€”mimicking a vehicle returning to its parking spot.
      This entire process repeats endlessly, creating a looped simulation of real-world automated vehicle behavior.
