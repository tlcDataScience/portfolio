intro: >
  Hi, My name is [student_nickname]!

  After I began to learn block-based coding in robotics in Primary 3, I started seeing real-world problems in a more logical way.
  I managed to learn how to design and build a large variety of robots for various uses.
  It was also a great opportunity to improve my focus, patience and ability to work through challenges step-by-step.
  It was very eye-opening, seeing how technology can be used to solve real-world issues.
  I also felt inspired to be more creative, innovative and curious about how things work.
  Most of all, it has made learning exciting for me!

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Touch-Activated Catapult"
    heading: Touch-Activated Catapult
    description: >
    I built a catapult using LEGO Technic parts that launches bullets when a touch sensor is pressed. Working on this taught me that simple code can control real machines â€“ it was super cool to see the catapult move exactly when I touched it!

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic activated rack and pinion door"
    heading: Ultrasonic activated rack and pinion door
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I built a rack and pinion door. Using an ultrasonic sensor, I recreated an automatic sliding door like those commonly found in shopping centers. 
      The door opens when a person is detected within a certain range, demonstrating how sensor technology is used in real life to improve accessibility, convenience, and energy efficiency in public buildings

other_achievements:
  - title: "Minecraft Foundation"
    description: >
      I participated in the Minecraft Foundation program, where I learned how to use Minecraft as a platform for coding and creativity.
      I explored various coding concepts while building and designing structures in the game, enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding of programming logic.
