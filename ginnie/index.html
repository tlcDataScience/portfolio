intro: >
  Hello, I am Ginnie Chia! I enjoy building robots and using coding to solve real-world problems. Starting with block-based coding helped me understand how to control my robots and test new ideas. Learning robotics has strengthened my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, because I have to break big challenges into smaller steps and troubleshoot when things don’t work as expected. It has also taught me patience and creativity, since designing, building, and programming robots often requires multiple experiments and improvements. Through robotics, I’m learning how software and hardware work together, which helps me better understand technology and how it can be used to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient.

  - title: "Project 1: Bumper Car "
    heading: Bumper Car
    description: I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a collision—mimicking real-world applications of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.
