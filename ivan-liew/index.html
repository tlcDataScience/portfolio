intro: >
  My name is Ivan, and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 4. I enjoy designing and building robots and structures that automate routine tasks in my daily life.
  Learning robotics taught me to solve real-world problems and inspired me to explore beyond block-based coding. This sparked my interest in Python, where I began writing programs to solve math problems without using pen and paper.
  As I strengthened my Python skills, I also learned Pygame and created educational games that my friends could play and compete in.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ferris Wheel"
    heading: "Ferris Wheel"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a ferris wheel that moves only when the touch sensor is activated. 
      This simulates real-world operator-driven control to ensure safety.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    heading: "Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I built a tractor. Using the ultrasonic sensor, the tractor moves when it detects a load on it.

  - title: "Project 3: 2 Touch Activated Gripper"
    heading: "2 Touch Activated Gripper"
    description: >
      I created a robotic gripper that opens and closes only when a touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved a toy rabbit head that spins in the wind, so I created an automated version...

  - title: "Project 5: Colour and Infrared Activated Spinning Top"
    heading: "Colour and Infrared Activated Spinning Top"
    description: >
      This is a sensor-controlled spinning top...

  - title: "Project 6: Touch Activated Treadmill"
    heading: "Touch Activated Treadmill"
    description: >
      I designed a treadmill-like system where speed increases with each touch...
