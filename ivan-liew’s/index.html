intro: >
  My name is Ivan, and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 4. I enjoy designing and building robots and structures that automate routine tasks in my daily life.
  Learning robotics taught me to solve real-world problems and inspired me to explore beyond block-based coding. This sparked my interest in Python, where I began writing programs to solve math problems without using pen and paper.
  As I strengthened my Python skills, I also learned Pygame and created educational games that my friends could play and compete in.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ferris Wheel"
    heading: "Ferris Wheel"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a ferris wheel that moves only when the touch sensor is activated. 
      This simulates the real world when it is operator driven to ensure safety.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor "
    heading: "Ultrasonic Activated Tractor "
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I built a tractor. Using the ultrasonic sensor, the tractor moves when it detects the load on it. 
      Such autonomous track-based vehicles are used to transport goods between different stations. 
      Once the sensor detects the object, the vehicle automatically moves to deliver the item to the designated location. 
      This automation reduces the need for human labor, increases efficiency, and ensures precise handling of materials.

  - title: "Project 3: 2 touch activated gripper"
    heading: "Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to apply the same concepts and design principles to create a robotic gripper that opens and closes only when a touch sensor is activated. 
      This mechanism allows for precise control, mimicking the arcade claw machine’s motion. Beyond recreation, this design has real-world applications — 
      such as in assistive robotics, where touch-sensitive grippers can help individuals with limited mobility pick up and release objects safely, or in industrial automation, where the system can handle delicate components without causing damage. 
      By integrating touch-based activation, the gripper combines fun design inspiration with practical functionality for real-world use.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. 
      They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, 
      I decided to create an automated version of the toy.
      In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. 
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Colour and infrared activated spinning top "
    heading: "Colour and infrared activated spinning top "
    description: >
      Playing the top is my childhood game and I decided to recreate a sensor-controlled spinning top using LEGO technic parts and coded it to move when it is activated by a colour sensor. 
      I could control the direction it spins using an infrared sensor when it detects someone within different range. If the infrared sensor detects someone near it, it will spin clockwise, else, 
      it spins anti-clockwise. This setup mirrors real-life smart devices that respond to environmental cues. 
      The system responds intuitively to human presence, creating an interactive and dynamic user experience.

  - title: "Project 6: Touch activated Treadmill"
    heading: "Touch activated Treadmill"
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys exercising on a treadmill, I decided to recreate an automated treadmill using LEGO Technic parts. 
      This miniature version functions similarly to a real treadmill—its speed is controlled by user input. 
      With the use of a touch sensor, and coding concepts such as variables and if-else statements, the treadmill increases speed with each press—just like speed adjustments on a real gym machine.
