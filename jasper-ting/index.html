intro: >
  My name is [student_nickname], and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 4. 
  I enjoy designing and building robots and structures that automate simple tasks in my daily life.
  Robotics taught me how to solve real-world problems and motivated me to go beyond block-based coding. 
  This sparked my interest in Python, where I began writing programs to help me solve math problems without using pen and paper.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Catapult"
    heading: "Catapult"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I programmed my designs to perform specific actions based on real-time input. 
      For example, I created a catapult  mechanism that swings to hit the target when the touch sensor is activated—demonstrating how sensor-triggered automation is used in real-world systems that respond to user

  - title: "Project 2: Rack And Pinion Door"
    heading: "Rack And Pinion Door "
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. 
      Using LEGO Technic parts and a colour sensor, 
      I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. 
      This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    heading: "Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    description: >
      Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, I applied the design principles and coding skills 
      I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. 
      The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. 
      When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. 
      This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, similar to those used in vending machines.

  - title: "Project 4: Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, 
      which spins when the wind hits it. They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, I decided to create an automated version of the toy.
      In this upgraded version, 
      the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. 
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Color And Ultrasonic Activated Spinning Top"
    heading: "Color And Ultrasonic Activated Spinning Top"
    description: >
      Playing the top is my childhood game and I decided to recreate a 
      sensor-controlled spinning top using LEGO technic parts and coded 
      it to move when it is activated by a color sensor. 
      I could control the direction it spins using an ultrasonic sensor when 
      it detects someone within different range. 
      If the ultrasonic sensor detects someone near it, it will spin clockwise, else, it spins anti-clockwise. This setup mirrors real-life smart devices that respond to environmental cues. The system responds intuitively to human presence, creating an interactive and dynamic user experience.
