intro: >
  My name is Joshua, and I am 12 years old this year. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms together with block-based coding when I was in Primary 4.
  I enjoy working on different structures and robots, designing and building them to automate routine daily tasks in my life.
  Learning robotics helped me solve real-world problems, and I was eager to explore beyond block-based coding.
  This sparked my interest in learning Python, a text-based programming language.
  I wanted to write programs to help me solve math problem sums without using pen and paper.
  I also learned how to use Pygame, where I created different games that my friends could play to compete and challenge one another.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Bumper Car"
    heading: "Bumper Car"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems.
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating sensors, I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment.
      One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a collision. 
      This mimics real-world obstacle detection systems used in autonomous vehicles to enhance safety and navigation.

  - title: "Project 2: Rack and Pinion Door"
    heading: "Rack and Pinion Door"
    description: >
      I built various mechanical structures using LEGO Technic parts and applied conditional logic (if-else) with different sensors.
      For this project, I created a rack and pinion automatic door using an ultrasonic sensor.
      The door opens when a person is detected within a certain distance, just like the automatic sliding doors commonly found in shopping centers.
      This project demonstrates how sensor technology improves accessibility, convenience, and energy efficiency in real-life buildings.

  - title: "Project 3: Motor-Controlled Jack-In-The-Box"
    heading: "Motor-Controlled Jack-In-The-Box"
    description: >
      Wanting to create a fun toy to prank my siblings, I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a Jack-in-the-Box mechanism.
      The toy is controlled by a handheld motor that activates the opening and closing of the box.
      By spinning the motor in a specific sequence of directions, the Jack springs out, demonstrating how programmed mechanical sequences create interactive and entertaining devices similar to automated toys used in consumer products.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch-Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch-Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings enjoyed playing with their toy rabbit head, which spun when the wind hit it. They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited.
      To make it more interactive, I created an automated version.
      In this upgraded design, the rabbit head spins automatically when the program starts. When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.
      This project demonstrates how sensors can bring simple toys to life.
