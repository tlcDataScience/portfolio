intro: >
  My name is Joshua and I am 12 years old this year. I started learning robotics with the Lego Mindstorms together with block-based coding when I was in Primary 4.  
  I enjoy working on different structures and robots, designing and building them to automate routine daily tasks in my life.
  Learning robotics helped me to solve real world problems. I was eager to explore beyond block-based coding. 
  This spark my interest in learning python, text-based coding. 
  I wanted to write codes to help me solve my math problem sums without the use of the pen and paper.
  I leant how to use Pygame and created different games that my friends could compete and challenge one another. 
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, Innovation and STEM.
robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Bumper Car"
    heading: "Bumper Car"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a 
      collision—mimicking real-world applications of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.

  - title: "Project 2: Rack and Pinion Door"
    heading: "Rack and Pinion Door"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I built a rack and pinion door. Using an ultrasonic sensor, 
      I recreated an automatic sliding door like those commonly found in shopping centers. 
      The door opens when a person is detected within a certain range, demonstrating how sensor technology is used in real life to improve accessibility, 
      convenience, and energy efficiency in public buildings

  - title: "Project 3: Motor Controlled Jack In The Box"
    heading: "Motor Controlled Jack In The Box"
    description: >
      Wanting to create a fun toy to prank my siblings, 
      I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a build a Jack-in-the-Box mechanism. 
      It’s controlled by a handheld motor that activates the opening and closing of the box. 
      By spinning the motor in a specific sequence of directions, the Jack springs out, 
      demonstrating how programmed mechanical sequences can create interactive and 
      entertaining devices—similar to automated toys and novelty mechanisms used in entertainment and consumer products.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. 
      They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, 
      I decided to create an automated version of the toy.
      In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. 
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, 
      and the toy returns to its original position.
