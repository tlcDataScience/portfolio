intro: >
  My name is Ethan, and I am 12 years old. I began learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding when I was in Primary 4. 
  I enjoy designing and building different structures and robots, especially those that help automate simple daily tasks.
  Learning robotics taught me how to solve real-world problems and sparked my curiosity to go beyond block-based coding. 
  That was when I became interested in Python, a text-based programming language. I wanted to create programs that could help me solve math problems without needing pen and paper.
  I also learned how to use Pygame, where I developed various games for my friends to play and challenge each other. 
  Throughout this journey, I have been documenting my experiences in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.
robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Bumper Car"
    heading: "Bumper Car"
    description: >
    I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
    By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors,
    I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
    One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a collision—mimicking 
    real-world applications of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    heading: "Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I built a tractor. Using the ultrasonic sensor, the tractor moves when it detects the load on it. 
      Such autonomous track-based vehicles are used to transport goods between different stations. 
      Once the sensor detects the object, the vehicle automatically moves to deliver the item to the designated location. 
      This automation reduces the need for human labor, increases efficiency, and ensures precise handling of materials.

  - title: "Project 3: Motor Controlled Jack In The Box"
    heading: "Motor Controlled Jack In The Box"
    description: >
      Wanting to create a fun toy to prank my siblings, 
      I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a build a Jack-in-the-Box mechanism. 
      It’s controlled by a handheld motor that activates the opening and closing of the box. 
      By spinning the motor in a specific sequence of directions, the Jack springs out, 
      demonstrating how programmed mechanical sequences can create interactive and entertaining 
      devices—similar to automated toys and novelty mechanisms used in entertainment and consumer products.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch-Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch-Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings enjoyed playing with their toy rabbit head, which spun when the wind hit it. They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited.
      To make it more interactive, I created an automated version.
      In this upgraded design, the rabbit head spins automatically when the program starts. When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.
      This project demonstrates how sensors can bring simple toys to life.

  - title: "Project 5: Touch Activated Lazy Susan"
    heading: "Touch Activated Lazy Susan"
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys eating at restaurant—especially chinese restaurant, 
      I recreated a lazy susan using LEGO Technic parts. 
      It incorporates 1 touch sensor and ultrasonic sensor to make decisions about when and how to spin, 
      based on when the touch sensor is activated and when the ultrasonic sensor detects something near it. 
      This adds a layer of convenience and control that reflects how real-world rides use environment-sensitive automation.

  - title: "Project 6: Touch Activated Treadmill"
    heading: "Touch Activated Treadmill "
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys exercising on a treadmill, 
      I decided to recreate an automated treadmill using LEGO Technic parts. 
      This miniature version functions similarly to a real treadmill—its speed is controlled by user input. 
      With the use of a touch sensor, and coding concepts such as variables and if-else statements, 
      the treadmill increases speed with each press—just like speed adjustments on a real gym machine.
