intro: >
  My name is Ethan, and I am 12 years old. I began learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding when I was in Primary 4.
  I enjoy designing and building different structures and robots, especially those that help automate simple daily tasks.
  Learning robotics taught me how to solve real-world problems and sparked my curiosity to explore beyond block-based coding.
  That was when I became interested in Python, a text-based programming language. I wanted to create programs that could help me solve math problems without using pen and paper.
  I also learned how to use Pygame, where I developed various games for my friends to play and challenge one another.
  Throughout this journey, I have been documenting my experiences in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Bumper Car"
    heading: "Bumper Car"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems.
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors,
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment.
      One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a collision—
      mimicking real-world applications of obstacle detection in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    heading: "Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    description: >
      I used LEGO Technic parts to build a tractor with an ultrasonic sensor.
      When the tractor detects a load placed on it, it automatically starts moving.
      This is similar to autonomous track-based vehicles used to transport goods in warehouses.
      Once the sensor detects an object, the vehicle moves to deliver the item to a designated location,
      helping increase efficiency and reduce the need for manual labor.

  - title: "Project 3: Motor-Controlled Jack-in-the-Box"
    heading: "Motor-Controlled Jack In The Box"
    description: >
      I wanted to create a fun toy to prank my siblings, so I designed a Jack-in-the-Box mechanism using LEGO Technic parts.
      It is controlled by a handheld motor that activates the opening and closing of the box.
      By spinning the motor in a programmed sequence, the Jack pops out—showing how mechanical movements and coding
      can create interactive and entertaining devices like automated toys.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch-Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch-Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings enjoyed playing with a toy rabbit head that spun when wind hit it.
      To make it more interactive, I built an automated version that spins on its own when the program starts.
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby, the spinning stops and the head returns to its original position.
      This project demonstrates how sensors can bring simple toys to life.

  - title: "Project 5: Touch Activated Lazy Susan"
    heading: "Touch Activated Lazy Susan"
    description: >
      Since I enjoy eating at Chinese restaurants, I decided to recreate a lazy Susan using LEGO Technic parts.
      It uses a touch sensor and an ultrasonic sensor to determine when and how to spin.
      This adds convenience and reflects how real-world systems use environmental input for automation.

  - title: "Project 6: Touch Activated Treadmill"
    heading: "Touch Activated Treadmill"
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys exercising, I recreated a treadmill using LEGO Technic parts.
      This miniature version works similarly to a real treadmill—its speed changes based on user input.
      Using a touch sensor and coding concepts like variables and if-else statements,
      the treadmill increases speed with each press, just like an actual gym machine.
