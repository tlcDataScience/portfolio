intro: >
  My name is Julius and I am 12 years old this year. I started learning robotics with the Lego Mindstorms together with block-based coding when I was in Primary 4.  
  I enjoy working on different structures and robots, designing and building them to automate routine daily tasks in my life.
  Learning robotics helped me to solve real world problems. I was eager to explore beyond block-based coding. 
  This spark my interest in learning python, text-based coding. 
  I wanted to write codes to help me solve my math problem sums without the use of the pen and paper.
  I leant how to use Pygame and created different games that my friends could compete and challenge one another. 
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, Innovation and STEM.

  - title: "Project 1: Catapult"
    heading: "Catapult"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures.
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I programmed my designs to perform specific actions based on real-time input. For example, 
      I created a catapult mechanism that swings to hit the target when the touch sensor is activated—demonstrating 
      how sensor-triggered automation is used in real-world systems that respond to user

  - title: "Project 2: Sushi Belt"
    heading: "Sushi Belt"
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. 
      Using the lego technic parts and a colour sensor, 
      I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    heading: "Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    description: >
      Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, 
      I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. 
      The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. 
      When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. 
      This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, 
      similar to those used in vending machines .

  - title: "Project 4: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: "Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. 
      They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, 
      I decided to create an automated version of the toy.
      In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. 
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, 
      and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Tea Cup Ride"
    heading: "Colour and Infrared Activated Spinning Top"
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys visiting amusement parks—especially the tea cup ride, I recreated a classic amusement park teacup ride using LEGO Technic parts. It incorporates two color sensors to make decisions about when and how to spin, based on both the color detected and the amount of reflected light. This adds a layer of safety and control that reflects how real-world rides use environment-sensitive automation.
