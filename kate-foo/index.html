intro: >
  My name is Kate Foo, and I’m 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 3, 
  and I’ve enjoyed building robots and structures that automate simple tasks in my daily life.
  Robotics has made me a better problem solver by teaching me to think logically, creatively, and step by step. 
  It has improved my focus, patience, and ability to test and refine my ideas. Through robotics, 
  I’ve also developed useful skills like coding, teamwork, and critical thinking, and I’ve learned how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.
  Most of all, robotics has made learning fun and exciting—and I’ve documented my journey along the way.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1 – Ferris Wheel"
    heading: "Ferris Wheel"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. One example was a ferris wheel that moves only when the touch sensor is activated. 
      This simulates the real world when it is operator driven to ensure safety.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Sensor activated cuckoo clock"
    heading: "Ultrasonic Sensor activated cuckoo clock"
    description: >
      I applied coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and using an ultrasonic sensor, 
      I built a rack and pinion door mechanism that automatically opens when it detects someone approaching. 
      This project simulates real world automatic door systems commonly found in malls and offices.

  - title: "Project 3: Touch activated gripper"
    heading: "Touch activated gripper"
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, 
      I decided to use the concepts and design skills to create a gripper that is activated to open and close only when touch sensor is activated. 
      I could then recreate the arcade game of picking up and releasing anything at home

  - title: "Project 4: Touch and ultrasonic satellite shooter"
    heading: "Touch and ultrasonic satellite shooter"
    description: >
      I designed a rack and pinion–based launcher mechanism designed to deploy a satellite into space and the system is activated only when two conditions are met simultaneously: 
      When both conditions are true, the launcher’s motorized rack and pinion system engages, propelling the satellite model forward. 
      Once the cycle is complete, the system resets and waits for both conditions to be met again before the next launch. In real-world space missions, 
      multi-sensor activation systems are used to ensure safety, precision, and intentional operation.

  - title: "Project 5: Touch and ultrasonic activated lazy susan"
    heading: "Touch and ultrasonic activated lazy susan"
    description: >
      My family loves having dinners together, so I decided to recreate an automatic one with lego parts. 
      I built a touch-activated Lazy Susan to make sharing food more fun and convenient. When the touch sensor is pressed, the Lazy Susan begins to spin. 
      The direction of the spin—clockwise or counterclockwise—is determined by the reading from an ultrasonic sensor. 
      Depending on how close our hand is to the sensor, the turntable will rotate in one direction or the other.

  - title: "Project 6: Colour and touch speed activated merry go round"
    heading: "Colour and touch speed activated merry go round"
    description: >
      I enjoy working with remote-controlled mechanisms, 
      so I designed and built a fan blade system that adjusts its speed based on user input. 
      The fan increases its rotational speed whenever a control button is pressed on the remote. 
      This design simulates how smart appliances and remote-controlled ventilation systems operate. 
      Modern ceiling fans, drones, and cooling systems use similar control logic—where user 
      input or environmental sensors regulate motor speed for efficiency and comfort.
