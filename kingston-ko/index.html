intro: >
  Hi, I'm [student_nickname]!
  I love building robots and coming up with creative ways to solve real-world problems. I started learning robotics in Primary 4 with Lego Mindstorms and block-based coding. That’s where I first learned how to control robots and test different ideas.
  After a while, I wanted to try something more advanced, so I started learning Python. Python helped me think step by step, write my own programs, and even solve tricky math problems without pen and paper.
  I also explored game development using Pygame, creating fun and educational games for my friends to play. Competing in these games makes learning feel like a fun challenge instead of just studying.
  Combining robotics and Python makes me excited because I can build projects that help people, make learning more enjoyable, and inspire others to be creative with technology. I hope you enjoy seeing what I’ve built!

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ping Pong Racket"
    heading: "Ping Pong Racket"
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. 
      Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, 
      I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. 
      Among many other projects, I created a ping pong racket that hits the ball if the touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 2: Sushi Belt"
    heading: "Sushi Belt"
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. Using the LEGO technic parts and a colour sensor, I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    heading: "Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    description: >
      Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, similar to those used in vending machines.

  - title: "Project 4:Colour and infrared activated standard robot"
    heading: "Colour and infrared activated standard robot"
    description: >
      I decided to create an automated car using LEGO Technic parts that can return to its original parking position after detecting an obstacle.
      This project simulates the logic behind autonomous parking systems found in modern vehicles.
      Using the concept of nested while loops with variables, I programmed the car to activate and begin moving when the colour sensor detects a specific colour. 
      While in motion, the car continuously checks for obstacles using the infrared sensor. Once an obstacle is detected, 
      the car automatically stops and reverses back to its starting point—mimicking a vehicle returning to its parking spot.
      This entire process repeats endlessly, creating a looped simulation of real-world automated vehicle behavior.

  - title: "Project 5: 2 sensors activated Lazy susan"
    heading: "2 sensors activated Lazy susan"
    description: >
      My family loves having dinners together, so I decided to recreate an automatic one with lego parts. 
      I built a touch-activated Lazy Susan to make sharing food more fun and convenient. 
      When the touch sensor is pressed, the Lazy Susan begins to spin. The direction of the spin—clockwise or counterclockwise—is 
      determined by the reading from an ultrasonic sensor. Depending on how close our hand is to the sensor, the turntable will rotate in one direction or the other.

  - title: "Project 6: Merry go round amusement ride"
    heading: "Merry go round amusement ride"
    description: >
      I built a lego model of a 2 swings that is fully automated to replicate how a real amusement ride would respond to inputs from sensors. 
      The colour sensor is used to decrease the rotation speed of swing 1 while the touch sensor increases the speed of swing 2, this enhances user experience and safety.
