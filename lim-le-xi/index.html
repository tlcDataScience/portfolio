intro: >
  My name is Le Xi, and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 4, 
  where I enjoyed designing and building robots to automate daily tasks.
  Robotics inspired me to solve real-world problems and explore beyond block-based coding, which led me to learn Python. 
  Using Python, I wrote programs to solve math problems without pen and paper. 
  I also learned Pygame to create educational games where my friends could compete and challenge one another.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Bumper Car"
    heading: Bumper Car
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor 
      detects a collision—mimicking real-world 
      applications of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.

  - title: "Project 2: Sushi Belt"
    heading: Sushi Belt
    description: >
      I enjoy going to the restaurant for sushi and decided to recreate an automated one. 
      Using the lego technic parts and a colour sensor, 
      I created a sushi belt that is activated to move only when it detects the colour green. 
      This reduces unnecessary motion and saves energy.

  - title: "Project 3: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser"
    heading: Distance Sensor Coin Dispenser
    description: >
      Inspired by arcade coin dispensers, 
      I applied the design principles and coding skills I learned to build a distance-activated coin dispenser. 
      The dispenser uses two ultrasonic sensors that detect my hand in a specific sequence within a defined distance threshold. 
      When both sensors are triggered in order, the mechanism opens to release coins. 
      This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can create automated systems, 
      similar to those used in vending machines .

  - title: "Project 4: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. 
      They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, 
      I decided to create an automated version of the toy.
      In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. 
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Touch Activated Lazy Susan"
    heading: Touch Activated Lazy Susan
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys eating at restaurant—especially chinese restaurant, 
      I recreated a lazy susan using LEGO Technic parts. 
      It incorporates 1 touch sensor and ultrasonic sensor to make decisions about when and how to spin, 
      based on when the touch sensor is activated and when the ultrasonic sensor detects something near it. 
      This adds a layer of convenience and control that reflects how real-world rides use environment-sensitive automation.

  - title: "Project 6: Touch & Colour Activated Merry Go Round "
    heading: Touch & Colour Activated Merry Go Round
    description: >
      As someone who enjoys exercising on a treadmill, 
      I decided to recreate an automated treadmill using LEGO Technic parts. 
      This miniature version functions similarly to a real treadmill—its speed is controlled by user input. 
      With the use of a touch sensor, and coding concepts such as variables and if-else statements, 
      the treadmill increases speed with each press—just like speed adjustments on a real gym machine.
