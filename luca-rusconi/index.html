intro: >
  Hi, I'm [student_nickname] and I am 12 years old. 
  I began learning robotics and block-based coding with Lego Mindstorms in Primary 2. 
  I enjoy designing and building robots to automate simple daily tasks.
  Learning robotics sparked my interest in Python, as I wanted to go beyond block coding and solve math problems using code. 
  Later, I explored Pygame to create fun, educational games for my friends to play and compete.
  I have documented my journey in robotics, coding, innovation, and STEM.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ferris Wheel"
    heading: "Ferris Wheel"
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a ferris wheel that moves only when the touch sensor is activated. 
      This simulates the real world when it is operator driven to ensure safety.

  - title: "Project 2: Motor controlled escalator"
    heading: "Motor controlled escalator"
    description: >
      I built a LEGO escalator controlled by the angle readings of a separate motor. 
      The system uses the rotation of the first motor to dynamically regulate the movement of the escalator, 
      enabling synchronized motion between the two components. This mirrors real-world motion control systems such escalators or moving walkways 
      which can be synchronized with sensors or mechanical systems that respond to human movement or operational demand.

  - title: "Project 3: Jack in the box"
    heading: "Jack in the box"
    description: >
      I love to prank my siblings, so I built a fun and interactive jack in the box using Lego technic parts. 
      The surprise character only jumps out when both motors reach a specific threshold that I have secretly set. 
      The exact condition stays known only to me, giving me full control over when the prank is trigged. My siblings never see it coming, 
      they would think its random but I’m the one behind the surprise every time.

  - title: "Project 4: Spinning rabbit head"
    heading: "Spinning rabbit head"
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head that spins when the wind hits it. 
      They had to spin and stop them manually. I decided to create an automated toy that starts moving when the program starts. 
      It will stop when ultrasonic sensor detects someone and return to the original position.

  - title: "Project 5: 2 Colour Sensors Controlled Tea Cup Ride"
    heading: "2 Colour Sensors Controlled Tea Cup Ride"
    description: >
      My family loves going to the amusement park to take the tea cup ride, so I decided to recreate an automatic one with lego parts. 
      When the touch sensor is pressed, the tea cup ride begins to spin. The direction of the spin—clockwise or counterclockwise—is determined by the reading from an ultrasonic sensor. 
      Depending on how close our hand is to the sensor, the ride will rotate in one direction or the other. 
      This demonstrates a basic form of sensor-driven logic, similar to how gesture-based or proximity-based interfaces work in interactive exhibits, robotics, or even smart home devices.

  - title: "Project 6: Geared king kong hands that increase speed"
    heading: "Geared king kong hands that increase speed"
    description: >
      I built a LEGO model of King Kong with geared hands that move faster when the infrared sensor detects my presence. 
      Using LEGO Technic gears, I designed a mechanism that increases the hand speed based on proximity readings. 
      Variables in the program adjust the motor power dynamically depending on how close I am to the sensor — 
      the closer I get, the faster the hands move. This system mimics how automated machines adjust behavior based on human presence, a concept used in fields like animatronics, 
      motion-activated robotics, and safety systems in manufacturing.
