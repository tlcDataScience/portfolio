intro: >
  My name is Michael Tan, and I am 12 years old this year. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding when I was in Primary 2. 
  Since then, I’ve really enjoyed designing and building different types of robots and structures to automate simple, everyday tasks in my life.
  Learning robotics has helped me become a better problem solver by encouraging me to think both logically and creatively. 
  It has also improved my focus, patience, and ability to work through challenges step by step. Through robotics, 
  I’ve learned how to break down complex problems, test out different solutions, and keep improving my designs.

    heading: Bumper Car
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors, 
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. 
      One example was a bumper car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects a collision—mimicking real-world applications 
      of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.
