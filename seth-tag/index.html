intro: >
  Hi, I'm [student_nickname]!
  and I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 3, 
  and since then I’ve enjoyed designing and building robots to automate simple tasks.
  Robotics has taught me to solve problems logically and creatively, and has improved my focus, patience, and step-by-step thinking. 
  It has also helped me develop future-ready skills like coding, teamwork, and critical thinking, while showing me how technology can solve real-world problems.
  Most of all, robotics has made learning fun, exciting, and inspiring.

  - title: "Project 1: Touch activated car"
    heading: Touch activated car
    description:
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems.
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors,
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment. One example was a car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects something,
      similar to a collision—mimicking real-world application of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems to enhance safety and navigation.
