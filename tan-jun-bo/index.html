intro: >
  Hi, I'm [student_nickname]!
  I am 12 years old. I started learning robotics with LEGO Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 3,
  and since then I’ve enjoyed designing and building robots to automate simple tasks.
  Robotics has taught me to solve problems logically and creatively, and has improved my focus, patience,
  and step-by-step thinking. It has also helped me develop future-ready skills like coding, teamwork,
  and critical thinking, while showing me how technology can solve real-world problems.
  Most of all, robotics has made learning fun, exciting, and inspiring.

robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Touch Activated Car"
    heading: Touch Activated Car
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build functional mechanical systems.
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and integrating various sensors,
      I programmed my creations to respond dynamically to their environment.
      One example was a car that automatically reverses when its front touch sensor detects an obstacle,
      mimicking real-world applications of obstacle detection used in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems.

  - title: "Project 2: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor"
    heading: Ultrasonic Activated Tractor
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures.
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors,
      I built a tractor that moves when its ultrasonic sensor detects a load.
      Such autonomous track-based vehicles are used to transport goods between stations,
      improving efficiency and reducing the need for manual labor.

  - title: "Project 3: Two Touch Activated Gripper"
    heading: Two Touch Activated Gripper
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to design a robotic gripper inspired by claw machines.
      The gripper opens and closes only when the touch sensor is activated, allowing for precise control.
      Beyond recreation, this design has real-world applications in assistive robotics and industrial automation,
      where touch-sensitive grippers can handle objects safely and accurately.

  - title: "Project 4: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head"
    heading: Touch Activated Automated Rabbit Head
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with a toy rabbit head that spins when wind hits it.
      To make it more interactive, I created an automated version.
      The rabbit head starts spinning when the program runs and stops when the ultrasonic sensor
      detects someone nearby, returning to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Follow The Line"
    heading: Follow The Line
    description: >
      Inspired by a line-following robot I observed at the library that transports books,
      I designed a similar robot for home use.
      My robot follows a black line on the floor to navigate efficiently through designated areas.
