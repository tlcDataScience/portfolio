intro: >
  Hi My name is Wallace, and I’m 12 years old. I began learning robotics with Lego Mindstorms and block-based coding in Primary 3, 
  which sparked my interest in designing robots to automate daily tasks. 
  Robotics taught me to think logically and creatively to solve real-world problems, inspiring me to move beyond blocks and learn Python.
robotics_projects:
  - title: "Project 1: Ping Pong Racket"
    heading: Ping Pong Racket
    description: >
      I learnt how to use the LEGO technic parts to create different designs. 
      Using the coding concept of conditionals (if-else), together with different sensors, I coded my designs to do certain actions only if a specific condition is met. 
      Among many other projects, I created a ping pong racket that hits the ball if the touch sensor is activated.

  - title: "Project 2:Colour activated sushi belt"
    heading: Colour activated sushi belt
    description: >
      I learned how to use LEGO Technic parts to design and build various mechanical structures. 
      By applying coding concepts such as conditionals (if-else) and incorporating different sensors, 
      I built a sushi conveyor belt system that automatically stops when a specific color is detected. 
      This mimics the function of an emergency stop button, commonly found in industrial automation and manufacturing environments, 
      where color or visual sensors are used to trigger safety protocols or halt operations in response to potential hazards

  - title: "Project 3: Color Activated Shooter"
    heading: Color Activated Shooter
    description: >
      Having played at the arcade frequently, I decided to use the concepts of conditional statements, colour detection and output controls to create a secure and precise shooter that fires a shot when the colour sensor detects 2 specific colours in the coded order. 
      This project demonstrates how sensor integration and conditional logic can be used to develop automated systems, with potential applications in intelligent defense technologies.

  - title: "Project 4: Ultrasonic automated toy rabbit head"
    heading: Ultrasonic automated toy rabbit head
    description: >
      My younger siblings loved playing with their toy rabbit head, which spins when the wind hits it. 
      They used to manually spin and stop it, which was fun but limited. To make it more interactive and engaging, 
      I decided to create an automated version of the toy.
      In this upgraded version, the rabbit head starts spinning automatically as soon as the program runs. 
      When the ultrasonic sensor detects someone nearby—such as a child approaching—the spinning stops, and the toy returns to its original position.

  - title: "Project 5: Touch and ultrasonic  activated lazy susan"
    heading: Touch and ultrasonic  activated lazy susan
    description: >
      My family loves having dinners together, so I decided to recreate an automatic one with lego parts. 
      I built a touch-activated Lazy Susan to make sharing food more fun and convenient. 
      When the touch sensor is pressed, the Lazy Susan begins to spin. 
      The direction of the spin—clockwise or counterclockwise—is determined by the reading from an ultrasonic sensor. 
      Depending on how close our hand is to the sensor, the turntable will rotate in one direction or the other.

  - title: "Project 6: Colour and touch speed activated merry go round"
    heading: Colour and touch speed activated merry go round
    description: >
      My younger brother enjoys riding a merry-go-round, 
      so I decided to build an automated LEGO Technic version for his imaginary friend. 
      The ride’s speed is controlled using both a touch sensor and a color sensor, 
      creating an interactive and responsive amusement ride experience. 
      The project uses key programming concepts such as variables and if-else logic to adjust the motor speed based on sensor inputs.  
      Using the coding concepts of variables and if else statements, 
      I programmed the merry go round to decrease speed when the colour sensor detects a specific value and to increase speed  when the touch sensor is activated.
